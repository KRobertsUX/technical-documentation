                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games,
                        in
                        the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic
                        styling;
                        with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your
                        understanding
                        of what is possible.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity
                        to
                        a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla
                        Foundation,
                        and the Mozilla Corporation).</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,
                        animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
                    <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of
                        tools on
                        top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.
                        These
                        include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing
                                functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and
                                manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio
                                samples.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other
                                content
                                providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of
                                building sites and applications.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details
                        of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in
                        MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of MDN.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var (less
                        recommended, dive deeper for the explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to
                        the variable:</p>
                    <code>let myVariable;</code>
                    <p class="note">Note: A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only
                        required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's
                        good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you
                        should and shouldn't use semicolons. For more details, see Your Guide to Semicolons in JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note">Note: You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions. (See
                        this section about naming rules.) If you are unsure, you can check your variable name to see if it's
                        valid.</p>
                    <p class="note">Note: JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable.
                        If you have problems in your code, check the case!</p>
                    <p class="note">Note: For more details about the difference between var and let, see The difference
                        between var and let.</p>
                    <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</p>
                    <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
                    <p>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:</p>
                    <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
                    <p>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</p>
                    <code>myVariable;</code>
                    <p>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:</p>
                    <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';
                        myVariable = 'Steve';</code>
                    <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</p>

                    <p>So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming.
                        If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting
                        message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.</p>

                    <p>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as
                        comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</p>
                    <code>/*
                        Everything in between is a comment.
                        */</code>
                    <p>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:</p>
                    <code>// This is a comment</code>

                    <p>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the

                                    negation operator tests whether two values are <code>not</code> equal.</p>

                    <p class="note">Note: Mixing data types can lead to some strange results when performing calculations. Be
                        careful that you are referring to your variables correctly, and getting the results you expect. For
                        example, enter <code>'35' + '25'</code> into your console. Why don't you get the result you expected?
                        Because the quote marks turn the numbers into strings, so you've ended up concatenating strings rather
                        than adding numbers. If you enter <code>35 + 25</code> you'll get the total of the two numbers.</p>

                    <p>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common
                        form of conditionals is the <code>if ... else</code> statement. For example:</p>
                    <code>let iceCream = 'chocolate';
                        if(iceCream === 'chocolate') {
                        alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');
                        } else {
                        alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p>The expression inside the <code>if( ... )</code> is the test. This uses the identity operator (as described above)
                        to compare the variable <code>iceCream</code> with the string <code>chocolate</code> to see if the two are equal. If this
                        comparison returns <code>true</code>, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second
                        block of code—after the <code>else</code> statement—runs instead.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>
                        Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions previously. For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');</code></li>
                        <li><code>alert('hello!');</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These functions, <code>document.querySelector</code> and alert, are built into the browser. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— <code>()</code> —it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, the <code>alert()</code> function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        function multiply(num1,num2) {
                            let result = num1 * num2;
                            return result;
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        Try running this in the console; then test with several arguments. For example:
                    </p>
                    <code>multiply(4, 7);
                        multiply(20, 20);
                        multiply(0.5, 3);
                    </code>                 
                    <p class="note">Note: The <code>return</code> statement tells the browser to return the <code>result</code> variable out of the function so it is available to use. This is necessary because variables defined inside functions are only available inside those functions. This is called variable scoping. (Read more about variable scoping.)</p>

                    <p>
                        Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage: 
                    </p>
                    <code>document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
                        alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        There are many ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the <span class="code">html</span> element, setting its <code>onclick</code>                               handler property equal to an anonymous (i.e. nameless) function, which contains the code we want the click event to run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that
                    </p>
                    <code>document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {};</code>
                    <p>is equivalent to</p>
                    <code>let myHTML = document.querySelector('html');
                        myHTML.onclick = function() {};
                    </code>
                    <p>It's just shorter.
