                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games,
                    in
                    the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic
                    styling;
                    with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your
                    understanding
                    of what is possible.</p>
                <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity
                    to
                    a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla
                    Foundation,
                    and the Mozilla Corporation).</p>
                <p>JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,
                    animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
                <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of
                    tools on
                    top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.
                    These
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing
                            functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and
                            manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio
                            samples.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other
                            content
                            providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of
                            building sites and applications.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details
                    of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in
                    MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of MDN.</p>

                <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var (less
                    recommended, dive deeper for the explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to
                    the variable:</p>
                <code>let myVariable;</code>
                <p class="note">Note: A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only
                    required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's
                    good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you
                    should and shouldn't use semicolons. For more details, see Your Guide to Semicolons in JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p class="note">Note: You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions. (See
                    this section about naming rules.) If you are unsure, you can check your variable name to see if it's
                    valid.</p>
                <p class="note">Note: JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable.
                    If you have problems in your code, check the case!</p>
                <p class="note">Note: For more details about the difference between var and let, see The difference
                    between var and let.</p>
                <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</p>
                <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
                <p>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:</p>
                <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
                <p>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</p>
                <code>myVariable;</code>
                <p>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:</p>
                <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';
                    myVariable = 'Steve';</code>
                <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</p>

                <p>So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming.
                    If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting
                    message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</p>
            <code>/*
                Everything in between is a comment.
                */</code>
                <p>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:</p>
                <code>// This is a comment</code>

            <p>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the JavaScript console.</p>

                        <p>"Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing "is myVariable NOT equal to 3". This returns false because myVariable IS equal to 3:</p>
                        <code>let myVariable = 3;
                            myVariable !== 3;</code>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>There are a lot more operators to explore, but this is enough for now. See Expressions and operators for a complete list.</p>
            <p class="note">Note: Mixing data types can lead to some strange results when performing calculations. Be careful that you are referring to your variables correctly, and getting the results you expect. For example, enter <code>'35' + '25'</code> into your console. Why don't you get the result you expected? Because the quote marks turn the numbers into strings, so you've ended up concatenating strings rather than adding numbers. If you enter <code>35 + 25</code> you'll get the total of the two numbers.</p>
